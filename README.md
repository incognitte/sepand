## Background

   Farsi  (Or  sometimes  referred  to  as  Persian) is the Language of us;
Iranians  (also  sometimes  called  Persians).  This Language has character
shapes other than Latin.  It has 32 alphabets that 26 of them are in common
with Arabic.  The number shapes are alike in most digits and can be used in
place of each other.

   Each  alphabet,  unlike Latin and Roman, may has several shapes, related
to  position  in  the  word.  Some has just one shape, and some has up to 4
shapes.   this  multi-shape characters make about 150 characters if we want
to  build all the exact forms.  Cause of such a big problem, the characters
shapes is reduced in normal DOS-Type screens.  There are some standards for
both  character  map  and  and  their position in ASCII table, but the most
popular standard is called IranSystem (made by IranSystem company).

   The   second   matter   is   direction.   Farsi  caligarphy  is  written
right-to-left  and the numbers are written left-to-right just like english.
Arabic  numbers are both written and read reversely, although the number is
seen as english and Farsi.

## What it Does

SEPAND does just one.  It gets resident in the system and:

   1)  DownLoads  Farsi  character  set  to  an  EPSON  Compatible (ESC/P2)
       Printer.
   2) Makes a  hotkey  to change output Farsi or English, enabling to print
      both languages  simultaneuosly.  If you have run the program, you can
      Select between types of printing alphabets and numbers, and which one
      Farsi/English,  but if your text  contains  some  special  characters
      (like checkmark),  you can't see the correct form.

## How to use

   Normally  people run it at startup, maybe in autoexec.  you can also run
whenever you need, at DOS prompt.  Copy the command where you like and then
call  it when needed.  This version is a one time resident program and this
means that if you run it more than one time, no problem will be occured.

   After  running  the program nothing visually happens.  Normal DOS prompt
will  be  work.   When  you  want to change the printer output, you have to
press both SHIFT keys simultaneously.  on your keyboard and an small window
appears  that  shows  printing options.  you have to choose desired options
and then download printer.
   In any text editor you can do the same for Farsi typing.

## Disclaimer & Copyright

usage,  but  as provider, I ask anybody to not use it for War, Making Guns,
or  any Bio/MicroBialogical warcrafts and/or Athomic, Neutronical Bombs and
